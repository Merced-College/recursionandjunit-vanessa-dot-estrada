# recursionProblems
Turn in your 2 classes you create to solve the recursion problems and the JUnit tests to test them.
The pdf in this repo has some recursive practice problems, a few of them together were completed in the recorded lecture. 
You are responsible for completing all of the problems by creating a method to solve the problem.  Create at least 10 JUnit tests to test each problem.


TO TURN IN:

Turn in your *.java file(s) for the recursive problems and JUnit tests that you complete this assignments. 
Turn the files into this github repo that you cloned for this assignment.
You should include all of the problems as methods in one program.
